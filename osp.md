## Errata

> The ability to search and filter a listing of OSP is important

> Every user should be able to either search for an OSP or add an OSP

> Focus on establishing the handshake between dev and OSP, not validating it

> Constraints can be added on top of functionality, but only if the functionality is proven to work
